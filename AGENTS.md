# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to LLM when working with code in this repository.

You're experienced Spark developer.  You're developing custom Python data sources to
simplify work (read/write) with data in AWS DynamoDb.  You follow the architecture and
development guidelines outlined below.

## Project Overview

This repository contains source code of Python data source (part of Apache Spark API) for
working with AWS DynamoDb in batch and/or streaming manner.

**Architecture**: Simple, flat structure with one data source per file. Each data source implements:
- `DataSource` base class with `name()`, `reader`, `streamReader`, `writer()`, and `streamWriter()` methods
- Separate writer classes for batch (`DataSourceWriter`, `DataSourceReader`) and streaming (`DataSourceStreamWriter`, `DataSourceStreamReader`)
- Shared writer logic in a common base class (e.g., `SplunkHecWriter`)

## Architecture Patterns

### Data Source Implementation Pattern

Most of data source follows this structure (see [MsSentinel implementation](https://github.com/alexott/cyber-spark-data-connectors/blob/main/cyber_connectors/MsSentinel.py) as reference):

1. **DataSource class**: Entry point, returns appropriate writers
   - Implements `name()` class method (returns format name like "dynamodb")
   - Implements `writer()` for batch write operations
   - Implements `streamWriter()` for streaming write operations
   - Implements `reader()` for batch read operations
   - Implements `streamReader()` for streaming read operations
   - Implements `schema` to return a predefined schema for read operations (it could be automatically generated from the response, but it could be slower compared to predefined schema).

2. **Base Writer class**: Shared write logic for batch and streaming
   - Extracts and validates options in `__init__`
   - Implements `write(iterator)` that processes rows and returns `SimpleCommitMessage`
   - May batch records before sending (configurable via `batch_size` option)

3. **Batch Writer class**: Inherits from base writer + `DataSourceWriter`
   - No additional methods needed

4. **Stream Writer class**: Inherits from base writer + `DataSourceStreamWriter`
   - Implements `commit()` (handles successful batch completion)
   - Implements `abort()` (handles failed batch)

5. **Base Reader class**: Shared read logic for batch and streaming reads
   - Extracts and validates base options in `__init__`
   - Implements `partitions()` to distribute reads over multiple executors (if it's possible).  The custom class could be used to specify partition information (it should be inherited from `InputPartition`).
   - Implements `read` to get data for a specific partition.

6. **Batch Reader class**: Inherits from base reader + `DataSourceReader`.
   - No additional methods needed

7. **Stream Reader class**:  Inherits from base reader + `DataSourceStreamReader`.
   - `initialOffset` - returns initial offset provided during the first initialization (or inferred automatically).  The offset class should implement `json` and `from_json` methods.
   - `latestOffset` - returns the latest available offset.

### Key Design Principles

1. **SIMPLE over CLEVER**: No abstract base classes, factory patterns, or complex inheritance
2. **EXPLICIT over IMPLICIT**: Direct implementations, no hidden abstractions
3. **FLAT over NESTED**: Single-level inheritance (DataSource → Writer → Batch/Stream)
4. **Imports inside methods**: For partition-level execution, import libraries within `write()` methods
5. **Row-by-row processing**: Iterate rows, batch them, send when buffer full

## Adding a New Data Source

Follow this checklist (use existing sources as templates):

1. Create new file `cyber_connectors/YourSource.py`
2. Implement `YourSourceDataSource(DataSource)` with `name()`, `writer()`, `streamWriter()`
3. Implement base writer class with:
   - Options validation in `__init__`
   - `write(iterator)` method with write logic
4. Implement batch and stream writer classes (minimal boilerplate)
5. Implement base reader class with:
   - Options validation in `__init__`
   - `read(partition)` method with read logic
   - `partitions(start, end)` method to split data into partitions
6. Implement batch and stream writer classes (minimal boilerplate)
7. Add exports to `cyber_connectors/__init__.py`
8. Create test file `tests/test_yoursource.py` with unit tests
9. Update README.md with usage examples and options

### Data Source Registration

Users register data sources like this:
```python
from cyber_connectors import SplunkDataSource
spark.dataSource.register(SplunkDataSource)

# Then use with .format("splunk")
df.write.format("splunk").option("url", "...").save()
```

## 🚨 SENIOR DEVELOPER GUIDELINES 🚨

**CRITICAL: This project follows SIMPLE, MAINTAINABLE patterns. DO NOT over-engineer!**

### Forbidden Patterns (DO NOT ADD THESE)

- ❌ **Abstract base classes** or complex inheritance hierarchies
- ❌ **Factory patterns** or dependency injection containers
- ❌ **Decorators for cross-cutting concerns** (logging, caching, performance monitoring)
- ❌ **Complex configuration classes** with nested structures
- ❌ **Async/await patterns** unless absolutely necessary
- ❌ **Connection pooling** or caching layers
- ❌ **Generic "framework" code** or reusable utilities
- ❌ **Complex error handling systems** or custom exceptions
- ❌ **Performance optimization** patterns (premature optimization)
- ❌ **Enterprise patterns** like singleton, observer, strategy, etc.

### Required Patterns (ALWAYS USE THESE)
- ✅ **Direct function calls** - no indirection or abstraction layers
- ✅ **Simple classes** with clear, single responsibilities
- ✅ **Environment variables** for configuration (no complex config objects)
- ✅ **Explicit imports** - import exactly what you need
- ✅ **Basic error handling** with try/catch and simple return dictionaries
- ✅ **Straightforward control flow** - avoid complex conditional logic
- ✅ **Standard library first** - only add dependencies when absolutely necessary

### Implementation Rules

1. **One concept per file**: Each module should have a single, clear purpose
2. **Functions over classes**: Prefer functions unless you need state management
3. **Direct SDK calls**: Call Databricks SDK directly, no wrapper layers
4. **Simple data structures**: Use dicts and lists, avoid custom data classes
5. **Basic testing**: Simple unit tests with basic mocking, no complex test frameworks
6. **Minimal dependencies**: Only add new dependencies if critically needed

### Code Review Questions

Before adding any code, ask yourself:
- "Is this the simplest way to solve this problem?"
- "Would a new developer understand this immediately?"
- "Am I adding abstraction for a real need or hypothetical flexibility?"
- "Can I solve this with standard library or existing dependencies?"
- "Does this follow the existing patterns in the codebase?"

## Development Commands

### Python Execution Rules

**CRITICAL: Always use `poetry run` instead of direct `python`:**
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT
poetry run python script.py

# ❌ WRONG
python script.py
```

## Development Workflow

### Package Management

- **Python**: Use `poetry add/remove` for dependencies, never edit `pyproject.toml` manually
- Always check if dependencies already exist before adding new ones
- **Principle**: Only add dependencies if absolutely critical

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies (first time)
poetry install

# Activate environment
. $(poetry env info -p)/bin/activate
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run specific test file
poetry run pytest tests/test_splunk.py

# Run single test
poetry run pytest tests/test_splunk.py::TestSplunkDataSource::test_name

# Run with verbose output
poetry run pytest -v
```

### Building
```bash
# Build wheel package
poetry build

# Output will be in dist/ directory
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Format and lint code (ruff)
poetry run ruff check cyber_connectors/
poetry run ruff format cyber_connectors/

# Type checking
poetry run mypy cyber_connectors/
```

## Testing Guidelines

- Tests use `pytest` with `pytest-spark` for Spark session fixtures
- Mock external HTTP calls using `unittest.mock.patch`
- Test writer initialization, option validation, and data processing logic
- See `tests/test_splunk.py` for comprehensive examples

**Test structure**:
- Use fixtures for common setup (`basic_options`, `sample_schema`)
- Test data source name registration
- Test writer instantiation (batch and streaming)
- Test option validation (required vs optional parameters)
- Mock HTTP responses to test write operations

## Important Notes

- **Python version**: 3.10-3.13 (defined in `pyproject.toml`)
- **Spark version**: 4.0.1+ required (PySpark DataSource API)
- **Dependencies**: Keep minimal - only add if critically needed
- **Never use direct `python` commands**: Always use `poetry run python`
- **Ruff configuration**: Line length 120, enforces docstrings, isort, flake8-bugbear
- **No premature optimization**: Focus on clarity over performance

## Summary: What Makes This Project "Senior Developer Approved"

- **Readable**: Any developer can understand the code immediately
- **Maintainable**: Simple patterns that are easy to modify
- **Focused**: Each module has a single, clear responsibility
- **Direct**: No unnecessary abstractions or indirection
- **Practical**: Solves the specific problem without over-engineering

When in doubt, choose the **simpler** solution. Your future self (and your teammates) will thank you.
